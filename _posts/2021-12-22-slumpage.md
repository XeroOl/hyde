A "slumpage" is an alternative difficulty for a modfile that is much harder than the original one. It can differ by chart, by mods, or in other ways. This document will show you how to make your code act differently on different difficulties, and how to add unlock conditions to some of your difficulties.

First, you'll want to create an extra chart for the slumpage difficulty. Traditionally, the slumpage difficulty is an "EDIT" difficulty. You can copy the chart from the normal file, or create a harder chart for your slumpage.

Then, you can detect the difficulty that the user selects in your mod file. Here's an example of how you can do that:
```lua
-- GetDifficulty() returns a number that represents which chart was selected
--
-- 0 = novice
-- ...
-- 4 = expert
-- 5 = edit    (or 'slumpage' in this context)
--
--
--1

local diff = GAMESTATE:GetCurrentSteps(pn-1):GetDifficulty()

-- You can make a variable that's only true when the selected difficulty is the slumpage
local slumpage = diff == 5

-- then, you can add extra code that only triggers if the slumpage difficulty is played
if slumpage then
    -- your extra mods here
end
```

Note that you'll need to provide a `pn`, or hardcode one. This is because it's possible that each player selected a different difficulty.


Now that you have a chart with extra difficulty, you've created a slumpage! Sometimes, we want the slumpage to be hidden until certain unlock conditions are met.

First, you need to set the `#UNLOCKSTEPS` property in the .sm file. This is best done by using a text editor. (Right click the .sm file, and click "Open with Notepad++" or something similar). Change the `#UNLOCKSTEPS` line so it exactly matches this:

```ini
#UNLOCKSTEPS::::::slumpage.lua;
```

Be sure to count those `:`'s properly. Once that's done, create a `slumpage.lua` file in the same folder as the .sm file.

Depending on what unlock conditions you want to have, you can write different things in the `slumpage.lua` file, but a common thing to do is to check if the user has at least a certain score on the "normal" difficulty.

Here's what you would put in the `slumpage.lua` if you want to require an 75% score or better to unlock the slumpage difficulty:

```lua
-- slumpage.lua

-- First get the Machine Profile, which is where the scores are stored
local prof = PROFILEMAN:GetMachineProfile()

-- Then, grab the user's high score for the expert chart. (4 represents the expert difficulty)
-- Notice that we check the current song using THIS_SONG
local highscore = prof:GetHighScoreForSongAndSteps(THIS_SONG, 4)

-- if the user doesn't have a score, then return "false" to show that the file is still locked
if not highscore then
	return false
end

-- grab the actual percentage from the high score
local percent = highscore:GetPercentDP()

-- only unlock if the high score is better than 75%
return percent > 0.75
```

You can read more about the high score objects on [CraftedCart's excellent documentation page](https://craftedcart.gitlab.io/notitg_docs/lua_api/high_score.html).
